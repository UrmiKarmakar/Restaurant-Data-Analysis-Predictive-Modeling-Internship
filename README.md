Restaurant Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling
This repository contains a comprehensive project for analyzing and predicting restaurant ratings based on a variety of features. The analysis includes several stages:
Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Explore and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, perform data type conversions, and analyze class imbalances in the target variable "Aggregate Rating."
Descriptive Analysis: Perform statistical analysis on numerical columns and explore the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines." Identify top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.
Geospatial Analysis: Visualize restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude, analyze distribution patterns across cities or countries, and explore correlations between location and restaurant ratings.
Table Booking & Online Delivery: Investigate the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery, compare ratings based on these features, and analyze online delivery across different price ranges.
Price Range Analysis: Identify the most common price range among restaurants, calculate average ratings for each range, and explore the correlation between price ranges and ratings.
Feature Engineering: Extract additional features like the length of restaurant names and addresses. Create new features by encoding categorical variables, such as "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery."
Predictive Modeling: Build regression models to predict aggregate ratings. The project includes model evaluation using different algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and performance comparison.
Customer Preference Analysis: Analyze the relationship between cuisine types and ratings, identify the most popular cuisines based on votes, and explore which cuisines tend to receive higher ratings.

Data Visualization: Visualize the distribution of ratings and compare ratings across different cuisines or cities. Gain insights through visualizations that represent relationships between features and target variables.

This project is an end-to-end analysis that demonstrates the application of data science techniques for real-world restaurant data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, geospatial analysis, and predictive modeling.
